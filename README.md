📊 Student Depression Analysis:
This project aims to analyze and understand the patterns and key factors that contribute to depression among students. Mental health issues among students have become increasingly common due to academic pressure, social expectations, and lifestyle challenges. With the help of data science and machine learning techniques, this project seeks to uncover insights that could assist in early detection and intervention.

🔍 Dataset Overview:
The dataset includes responses from students regarding their mental health status, daily habits, social interactions, academic performance, sleep patterns, and more. These features are analyzed to find correlations with reported depression levels.

⚙️ Technologies Used :
Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization

Scikit-learn for machine learning modeling

🧠 Project Workflow :
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and formatted data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized distributions and correlations between features like sleep, workload, and depression.

Feature Selection: Identified important attributes that influence depression using correlation heatmaps and statistical methods.

Modeling: Applied machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to predict whether a student is likely to be depressed.

Evaluation: Compared model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

📈 Key Insights :
Factors such as poor sleep, low motivation, and high academic stress are highly correlated with depression levels.

Visualization tools helped highlight patterns that are not immediately obvious from raw data.
